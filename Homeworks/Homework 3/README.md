## Understanding Power and Controlled Rectifiers

### Deadline: 18/12/2022 23:59

Please check [evaluation.md](evaluation.md) for other details and evaluation criteria about the project. Open a **private repository**, which you will put all your work into. Please add [me](https://github.com/OgunAltun) as a collaborator.

**1) Active Power Creation**<br />
 **a)** Let's say you have a voltage source supplying a current such as

 ![](voltageeqn.png)<br />
![](currenteqn.png)<br />

Calculate the supplied active power of this voltage source. Indicate the components creating active power.

*Even though having clear steps is important, you do not need to show each step in calculations. You can be direct reasonably.*

**b)** What is the rule of thumb to create nonzero active power?


**2) Single Phase Controlled Rectifier**<br />

Consider the single phase rectifier topologies shown below:

![](single_phase_rectifiers.png)

where V<sub>source</sub> = 230V/50Hz, R<sub>L</sub> = 4 Ω, L<sub>L</sub> = 150 mH, L<sub>s</sub> = 2 mH.

**a)** Calculate analytically the required firing angle α which results in an average output current value of 40 A for both topologies given above, and verify your calculations with simulations (Plot V<sub>o</sub> and its average).

**b)** Plot V<sub>source</sub> and I<sub>source</sub> on the same graph and find the THD value of I<sub>source</sub> for both topologies.

**c)** Compare the topologies with respect to their advantages, disadvantages and their application areas. Discuss their operational similarities and differences.


**3) Alternative Rectifier Topologies**<br />

Consider the power conversion topology depicted below:

![](OtherTopologies.gif)

**a)** Find the name of the topology and describe its operation and application areas. If you find other variations of this power conversion topology, briefly state them and discuss the differences.

**b)** Compare this topology with the full bridge diode rectifier. (You can simulate them both for the same operating conditions such that they both produce the same average output voltage.)
