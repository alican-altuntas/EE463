# EE 463 Hardware Project

## DC Motor Drive

### Deadlines:
- Complete Simulation Report and Presentation for Feedback Session - 24th of November
- Hardware Demo - 3th of January
- Final Report - 18th of January

In this project you are required to make a controlled rectifier that will be used to drive a DC Motor.

 - Power Input: 3 Phase, or 1 Phase AC Grid (Adjustable with variac)
 - Output: Adjustable **DC** Output (Vout,max = 180 V)

You are free to choose any topology such as (but not limited to and also encouraged to find other topologies):

 - Single Phase Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter
 - Three Phase Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

### Specs:

You are required to drive the following the DC motor (on the left). The motor will be loaded with the generator (on the right) coupled to the generator:

![](./motor-set.jpg)

![](./motor-label.jpg)

Specs of the all motor windings are measured as follows:

 - **Armature Winding:** 0.8 Ω, 12.5 mH
 - **Shunt Winding:** 210 Ω, 23 H
 - **[Interpoles](https://www.quora.com/Electrical-Machines-What-do-interpoles-do-in-DC-motors) Winding:** 0.27 Ω, 12 mH

In the project you will be supplied with a separate external DC source to feed the field winding (i.e. separately excited DC machine). However, you are free to make any other connection types such as shunt, series or compound if you want. You can use maximum two supply -excluding field excitation but including the main power source- to feed your motor driver circuitry. You must use the colour coded (positive red, negative black) banana plug connectors which will be given to you as input and output terminals of your design. Check out the [available component list](https://github.com/odtu/ee463/blob/master/Term%20Project/components.md).

You can use the variac to gradually apply AC voltage to your drive, and leave it any value you want, **but you can not use variac to control voltage during operation.**

### Project Steps:

- Choose your partners: Each group will consist of 3 people. You are free to choose your partners.

- Create a **public repo**: Open a public repo, which you will put all your work into. Please add [Ogün](https://github.com/OgunAltun) as a collaborator.

- Topology Selection: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each topology, and decide on a topology. You are required present your selection process in Complete Simulation Report.

- Computer Simulations: According the your topology selection, you are going to run computer simulations, to prove the performance characteristics of your drive. Start your simulations with simplest version. Then, it is best to simulate as detailed as possible to catch possible hardware problems (for example, how to generate control/gate signals).

- Component Selection: According to your analytical calculations and computer simulations decide on which components you are going to use. Not only choose the power components, but also decide on the control, and auxiliary components. Don't forget to plan logistics, it may take weeks to get some components.

- Implementation: Build a prototype as fast as possible, and keep iterating. You can try your design on breadborad (not suggested), but on the demo day your design should be implemented on a stripboard or PCB.

- Final Demo Day: In the demo day, you are expected to present your working prototypes. You are required to start the DC motor from standstill to rated speed under no load (but still you have the inertia, and the friction) and run for 2 minutes. You are allowed to soft start your drive (i.e for charging capacitors etc) with a variac, but variac should not be used to control the voltage while the motor is running.

### Grading

Project Outcomes:
- **Complete Simulation Report (15 pts):** A report that presents your design decisions, computer simulations, and component selection for the all parts of the project. Similar grading rules apply with previous projects (i.e. format, number of commits etc.)

- **Presentation for Feedback Session (15 pts):** Each team should present their topology selection and project design. They should describe how they selected critical components and their plan for design and manufacturing.

- **Demo Day (30 pts):** Each team is expected to present their prototype in the demo day. If you have a prototype, but somehow if it doesn't work on the demo day, you will get zero points from this part. However, if you don't come up with a prototype, or convince us that you put enough effort in building one, you will get zero points from the all hardware project (yes, even if you had the design report).

- **Final Report and Test Results (40 pts):** A report that presents your design decisions, computer simulations, component selection and test results. It should contain your results with the motor running (data can be collected on the demo day, but preferably earlier). The report can contain any other useful tests (i.e. functionality of the switches, tests with R load etc).  

#### Bonus Parts

You can get extra points in any of the following. In order to get bonus points, your design should meet the minimum requirements. *Start the DC motor from standstill to rated speed and run for 2 minutes.*

- **Topolgy Bonus:** Unique topologies will be rewarded. If you select a converter topology that no other groups use, you will be awarded by full bonus. If only two groups use the same topology, half bonus will be given for each. If three or more groups use the same topology, no bonus will be given for those groups.

- **Tea Bonus:** Boil the water inside 2 kW kettle. Kettle will be fed by AC machine, which is mechanically connected to the DC motor driven by your driver. The drive should supply minimum 2 kW power to the kettle for at least 5 minutes. You will also enjoy the tea of triumph after successfully boiling the water in the kettle.

- **PCB Bonus:** Implement your design on PCB. You can use PCB design softwares such as KiCad, Altium Designer, Proteus, Autocad Eagle, etc.

- **Utilization Bonus:** A bonus will be awarded to design with the tightest semiconductor ratings. Total Voltage-Ampere rating of power semiconductors will be evaluated.

- **Efficiency Bonus:** The project with the highest efficiency at rated load (2 kW) will be awarded with this bonus.

- **Industrial Design Bonus:** Enclose your design in a plastic/metal box (like one of [those](https://www.altinkaya.com.tr/Proje_Kutulari.html), not in a shoe box) and **label input/outputs with proper connections for safe operation.** You can design and 3D print your housing by using 3D printer available in our department. You can contact with [Mesut Özer](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/mesut-ozer) for details of 3D printing process or you can use the 3D printer in the Ground Lab. Secure the board and connections so that it does not get damaged when it is subjected to vibrations.

- **Compactness Bonus:** A bonus will be awarded to a project with the smallest volume (including all cabling, control circuitry, filters, connectors etc). The volume of the design will be calculated by finding the smallest possible rectangular prism that can contain the design. You must get Industrial Design Bonus to be eligible for this bonus.

- **Single Supply Bonus:** If you could feed the driver circuitry using only single supply (main power input: 3 Phase, or 1 Phase AC), you will be awarded with this bonus.

- **Analog Controller Bonus:** If an analog controller is used to control the drive rather than a digital controller a bonus will be awarded.

- **Four-Quadrant Bonus:** Normally you are required to make a single quadrant DC motor drive, but implement a four-quadrant drive to get this bonus.

- **Closed-loop Voltage/Current Control Bonus:** Implement a feedback loop to adjust the output voltage automatically and protect your drive against high currents.

- **Closed-loop Speed Control Bonus:** Implement a feedback loop to adjust the speed of the motor automatically.

- **Karma Bonus:** This bonus will be awarded to one person who helps most to everyone during the project period. This bonus will be awarded by the results of anonymous voting in the demo day.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- Do I need to buy all the components?

No, we will provide some mostly used components, but not all of them. Please check the [available component list](https://github.com/odtu/ee463/blob/master/Term%20Project/components.md).

- Can I use the lab before demo day?

Yes, you will be able to use power electronics lab.

- What equipment will be available for us in the lab?

You will be able to use oscilloscope, power supply, soldering station, function generator and variacs. You can also use the Ground Lab after getting required safety training and permission.

- Can I also work at nights in the lab?

Unfortunately, due to safety regulations, you have to work only under technician supervision during working hours.
